The CSI dataset contains 9 equi-distant datapoints. Each datapoint contains CSI data entries collected for 30 seconds duration.
The datapoints were collected while keeping the inter-point distance in space to be 2 meters apart. The file naming convention is represented as follows:
csi_RR_XX_YY.dat, where RR represents the router code, XX and YY represent the x and y coordinates of collection location in cartesian space, respectively.

Two routers were used for the dataset collection. Router location and details are given below.
